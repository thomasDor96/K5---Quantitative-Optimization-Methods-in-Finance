# Time Series Modelling:


## Introduction

This project aims to teach you the fundamentals of Time Series Analysis in Python. More specifically this respository aims to two basic time series modelling techniques: *AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average Models (ARIMA)*, *Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average Models (SARIMA)*. Time series analysis is important to understand as there are often problems or senarios where companies want to forecast a given product, service, or value a year down the line. For instance, airlines may want to forcase the future demand of plane seats for a given year, allowing management to price their tickets accordingly or Product Managers might want to forecast the users using a particular service for a years period, allowing the correct resource allocations based of seasonal trends in expected user for a given month.

## Theory and Notes:


See [`notes_pdf`](notes_pdf/) for a pdf of the theory and notes on Time Series modelling with (ARIMA, SARIMA, GARCH, ARCH)


## Notebooks


See [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) for the notebooks on Time Series modelling for different time series modelling techniques and explanations on the insights derived from different modelling techniques

## Future Implemtations:


Future implementations will include Time Series analysis with GARCH, and ARCH models, specifically on stock price forcasting
